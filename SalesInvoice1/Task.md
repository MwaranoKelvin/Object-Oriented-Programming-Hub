# 🧾 Java Assignment: Replicating Invoice Using `System.out.println()`

##  Objective
Write a Java program that replicates the attached invoice format **exactly** as it appears.  
The program should print the invoice layout **line by line** using only `System.out.println()` statements.

---

##  Requirements

1. Use only `System.out.println()` statements to reproduce the invoice format.
2. Under the **“Bill To”** section, replace *Thendral Supermarket* with your **registration number**.
3. Under the **“Ship To”** section, replace *Thendral Supermarket* with your **full name**.
4. Ensure **spacing, alignment, and borders** match the attached invoice as closely as possible.
5. **Do not use**:
   - Variables
   - Loops
   - Arrays
   - Formatting libraries
